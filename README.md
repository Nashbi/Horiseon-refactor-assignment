# Horiseon-refactor-assignment
This is Nashbi's very first module assignment, it contains edits and reviews to optimize the website.
This module contains updates with semantic elements, alt attributes, heading attributes, and all the things requested.
<h1> Believe me </h1>
We tried our best to create meaningful edits to optimize the best we could. You shouldn't find any errors, but if you do, mistakes happen and that's okay.
